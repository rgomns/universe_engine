# Aevum: The Self-Architecting Universe
> **A Study in Autonomous Constraint Satisfaction and Information-Theoretic Homeostasis.**

## 🌌 The "No-God" Hypothesis
Most simulations use hard-coded rules (gravity, friction, collision). **Aevum has zero hard-coded laws.** It is a 48-bit vacuum where "Physics" is not an input, but an **emergent survival strategy.** The system provides the "hunger" (Global Decay), but the bits themselves must invent the "geometry" of the laws required to persist.

## 🔬 Core Research Pillars

### 1. Emergence via Selection Pressure
The universe is seeded with random noise. Order emerges because the environment is fundamentally hostile:
* **The Filter:** A constant `GLOBAL_DECAY` prunes any bit-pattern that lacks a protective "Law."
* **The Reward Loop:** Constraints (laws) are generated randomly. Any law that accidentally describes a pattern in the noise is rewarded with "Life" (`CONSTRAINT_REWARD`). Useless laws suffer from **Temporal Decay** and are erased.
* **The Result:** The "Physics" of the universe is simply the set of the most successful mathematical descriptions of noise that refused to die.



### 2. The Logic of the "Big Crunch"
The collapse is not a bug; it is a **Phase Transition** triggered when the population ($\Omega$) falls below a critical threshold (Heat Death).
* **Information Survival:** While the bit-population is reset, the **Fundamental Laws** (those with >2000 cycles of age) act as a "Genetic Memory."
* **Ghost Laws:** These remnant laws survive the void and dictate the shape of the *next* Big Bang, reducing re-stabilization time by up to **75%**. This proves that information can survive the death of its medium.



### 3. Graph Topology & Unified Theory
In the early cycles, laws exist as "islands"—disconnected rules about specific bit-indices.
* **The Merging:** As the simulation matures, these islands merge into a **Largest Connected Component (LCC)**.
* **Structural Anchors:** The system autonomously identifies "Anchor Bits" (e.g., Bits 7, 29, 36). These are the structural hubs that the universe "chooses" to center its logic around to maintain global homeostasis.

## 📊 Phase Classification

Aevum classifies universes into three distinct thermodynamic states:

| Phase | Entropy State | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Subcritical** | High / Unstable | Laws die faster than they form; total chaos. |
| **Critical** | Moderate / Evolving | The "Edge of Chaos." High innovation and persistent complexity. |
| **Supercritical** | Low / Rigid | Frozen logic; the universe resists all new noise and innovation. |

## 🛠 Project Components

* **`universe_engine.py`**: The "Vacuum" where bits fight for persistence via 2-bit and 3-bit constraints.
* **`phase_sweep.py`**: A parallelized explorer that searches the "Multiverse" for parameters where life-like complexity is possible.
* **`plot_phase_map.py`**: Visualizes the "Habitable Zone" between total entropy and frozen rigidity.
