# Aevum: The Self-Architecting Universe
> **A Study in Autonomous Constraint Satisfaction and Information-Theoretic Homeostasis.**

## 🌌 The "No-God" Hypothesis
In Aevum, **Physics is a survival strategy.** Most simulations use hard-coded rules to dictate behavior. Aevum provides only a vacuum (48-bits) and a pressure (Global Decay). The "Laws" that govern the system are not inputs; they are the mathematical inventions of a system trying not to disappear.

## 🧮 The Master Equation
The stability of the Aevum universe is defined by the tension between emergent order and environmental noise:

$$\Large \Omega_{t+1} = \Omega_t \cdot e^{\sum R_i - \delta} + \Phi$$

* **$\Omega$ (Population):** The measure of systemic health.
* **$R_i$ (Constraint Reward):** The "Shielding" effect of evolved logic.
* **$\delta$ (Global Decay):** The entropic pressure of the vacuum.
* **$\Phi$ (Ghost Constant):** The immortal logical skeleton that survives systemic collapse.

## 🔬 The Lifecycle of Emergence

### 1. Emergent Growth (Order from Noise)
At Cycle 0, there is only noise. The system generates random "hypotheses" (Constraints). 
* **Autonomous Filtering:** Laws are not judged by a fitness function; they are judged by the **Decay.** If a law fails to identify a pattern, it decays and vanishes. 
* **Homeostasis:** Growth occurs when the sum of discovered patterns ($R_i$) creates a protective envelope stronger than the environmental decay ($\delta$).



### 2. The Emergent Crunch (Systemic Failure)
The "Big Crunch" is an emergent property of **Over-Specialization** or **Entropy Spikes.**
* When the evolved laws become too rigid (Supercritical) or too weak (Subcritical), the population $\Omega$ collapses.
* This isn't a programmed reset—it is the system hitting a **Thermodynamic Floor.** The universe collapses because it can no longer support the information density required for life.



### 3. The Ghost in the Machine (Stability across Rebirth)
The most profound emergence in Aevum is **Persistence.** * **Ghost Laws:** When the universe collapses, the bit-strings die, but the **Fundamental Laws** do not. 
* **The Scaffold:** These laws ($>2000$ cycles old) act as a "Genetic Memory." They dictate the symmetry of the next Big Bang, ensuring that the next universe starts not from chaos, but from the "Fossilized Logic" of its ancestor.

## 📊 Phase Topology

Aevum universes naturally settle into one of three emergent states:

| Phase | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Subcritical** | The "Evaporating Universe." Logic fails to take root; entropy dominates. |
| **Critical** | The "Living Universe." A constant, vibrating balance of innovation and persistence. |
| **Supercritical** | The "Crystal Universe." Logic becomes so rigid that the system ceases to evolve. |

## 🛠 Project Components
* **`universe_engine.py`**: The vacuum where bits compete for persistence.
* **`phase_sweep.py`**: A multi-verse explorer seeking the "Habitable Zone" of physics.
* **`plot_phase_map.py`**: Visualizes the phase boundaries of emergent order.
